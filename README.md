Allows bone meal to completely fertilize crops instantly.

Instant Fertilization requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).

## Installation

1. Install [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) if it is not installed.
2. Download Instant Fertilization from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/instant-fertilization/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Instant-Fertilization/releases).
3. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

When this mod is installed, crops with a final stage will always grow to that stage when bone meal is used to fertilize them. This includes the following vanilla blocks:

* Pumpkin and melon stems
* Cocoa
* Wheat, potatoes, carrots, and beetroot
* All types of saplings
* Both types of fungus
* Both types of mushroom plants
* Sweet berry bushes

## Tags

Any block added to the `#instantfertilization:instant_fertilization_blacklist` tag will retain its vanilla behavior when it is fertilized.
